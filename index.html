            <h2>This is Sage</h2>
            <p>	Sage is a one-man, melodic, atmospheric black metal project based out of the forests of Chicagoland. Nature, and the distinct seasons of Midwestern America, is at the heart of Sage’s music. Sage seeks to contribute to the atmospheric black scene, no matter on how small or large of a scale, and provide music and atmospheres that will enhance peoples’ experience with nature. </p><br>
            <p>Initially drawing influences from bands like Alcest and Agalloch, Sage’s influences were further refined and inspired by one-man projects like Saor, Elderwind, Skyforest, and VVilderness, among many others. Starting in late 2019, Sage decided to start creating its own music in the same vein of the projects listed above.</p><br>
            <p>Musically speaking, Sage is self-taught at every instrument. The drums are where Sage first started playing metal. Sage has continued drumming on and off for the better part of 16 years. In late 2006, Sage started practicing vocals and working with various projects with both drums and vocals, some more serious and successful than others. However, Sage wanted to create a project where they would be the only musician. Therefore, Sage purchased a guitar and was given a bass guitar by his wife late in 2019, and has been learning those instruments ever since. As a result, Sage’s sound is more drum and vocal centric as far as strengths go, which is unique for any metal genre. </p><br>
            <p>Although Sage is the sole writer and performer of the music, Sage has had extreme amounts of help from “Mystical Mike” who set up Sage’s basement studio and taught Sage how to use the recording software. “Mystical Mike” is the sole producer of all of Sage’s music and deserves a massive amount of credit for what Sage is, and will become. </p><br>
            <p>Sage’s music is, and always will be, completely free. Any future products will only reflect the product cost. No profit will be made. However, any donations are welcome and will go towards Sage’s four cats and one dog, or the National Parks Service. Please do not hesitate to reach out with any questions, or just to talk about music. </p><br>
            <p>Thanks,</p>
            <p>- Sage</p>
